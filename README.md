Hi, I’m @nasoboem
- I’m interested in sciences and building instruments that measure stuff, build your own tools to do science.
- I’m currently learning to use git for my school projects. Helping my students and helping my self and others.
- If anybody has some nice DIY-projects to build, to solder, to program, to collaborate, contact me. I would highly appreciate it.
